Hello and welcome to our very simple REST API created using NodeJs and Firebase Realtime Database as the datasource. Clone this repo for you to play around with it and hope it will be educational for you.

```
git clone <this repo>
cd <repo folder name>
npm install
```

Note: Make sure you have your Firebase project's service account handy. We need to place it on the <code>node_modules/firebase-admin</code> folder
